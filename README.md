# CAESER CYPHER
Caeser Cypher is a java application that encrypts or decrypts text using the Caeser Cypher technique. Users input a text they want encrypted or decrypted, and the shift key, and each letter is shifted forward by the number of letters the key value is during encryption, and backward during decryption.

## User Stories
1. The shift key must be between 1 and 25.
2. Only alphabetic letters are shifted. Numbers and other characters are returned notshifted.
3. During encryption, letters are shifted forward by the given shift key.
4. During decryption, letters are shifted backward by the given shift key.
